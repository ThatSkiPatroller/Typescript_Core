Type: Easy way to refer to the different properties +
functions that a value has

Primitive Types:
    - Number
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Symbol
    - Void
    - Null
    - Undefined

Object Types:
    - Functions
    - Classes
    - Arrays
    - Objects
Types we create or any other types built
into the language itself

Why two categories?
    - We can trick typescript compiler with object types,
      cannot do it with primitive types

Why do we care?
    - Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to 
      analyze our code for errors
    - Types allow other engineers to understand what
      values are flowing around our codebase
