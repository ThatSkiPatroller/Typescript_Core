Interfaces + classes is how we get really strong code reuse in TS

Interfaces --> Creates a new type, describing the property names and
               value types of an object

General strategy for reusable code in TS:
    - Create functions that accept arguments that are typed with Interfaces
    - Objects/classes can decide to 'implement' a given interface to work with
      a function
