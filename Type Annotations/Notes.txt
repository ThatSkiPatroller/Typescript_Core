Type annotations - Code we add to tell Typescript what 
type of value a variable will refer to

Type inference - Typescript tries to figure out what 
type of value a variable refers to

any type:
    - A type, just as 'string' or 'boolean' are
    - Means TS has no idea what this is - can't check
      for correct property references
    - Avoid variables with 'any' at all costs

Type annotations for functions:
    - Code we add to tell typescript what type of
      arguments a function will recieve and what type
      of values it will return

Type inference for functions:
    - Typescript tries to figure out what type of 
      value a function will return
